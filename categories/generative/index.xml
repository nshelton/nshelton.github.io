      <description>AR NFT Viewer In 2021, Sutu launched one of the first generative NFT series on the tezos blockshain, a 10,000 profile pic series called Neonz. I think this is one of the few great examples that demonstrates how to use web3 tech across platforms, while also being really cool art in its own right.
This was deveoped by the folks at Eyejack, I got on board to help them with some AR rendering effects for iOS and Android.</description>

      <description>My First Course In Fall 2021 I taught a class at Woodbury University in Burbank on some Advanced Programming techniques in Unity. This was in the Architecture School, aimed at non-computer Science majors who had already taken two semesters of Unity / gameplay programming. This was the first class I taught like this, and I learned a lot&amp;hellip; I made all the curriculum from scratch, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty proud of it so with their permission I&amp;rsquo;ve made it freely available here.</description>

      <description>Along with fractals, I also got really into growth algorithms, especially making them run in realtime. It seems like a perfect intersection of design and art with computer science and math.
Here are various realtime versions of some interesting growth algorithms I have seen over the years.
 Mesh based Mesh Splitting / Spring and attractive forces  Diffusion-Limited Aggregation   Voxel based Gray-Scott Anisotropic Dendritic Solidification  Mesh Based These involve splitting a manifold (1d or 2d surface) and then moving the nodes around in a higher dimensional space to minimise overlap</description>
