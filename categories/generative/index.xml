      <description>Along with fractals, I also got really into growth algorithms, especially making them run in realtime. It seems like a perfect intersection of design and art with computer science and math.
Here are various realtime versions of some interesting growth algorithms I have seen over the years.
 Mesh based Mesh Splitting / Spring and attractive forces  Diffusion-Limited Aggregation   Voxel based Gray-Scott Anisotropic Dendritic Solidification  Mesh Based These involve splitting a manifold (1d or 2d surface) and then moving the nodes around in a higher dimensional space to minimise overlap</description>
