      <description>My First Course In Fall 2021 I taught a class at Woodbury University in Burbank on some Advanced Programming techniques in Unity. This was in the Architecture School, aimed at non-computer Science majors who had already taken two semesters of Unity / gameplay programming. This was the first class I taught like this, and I learned a lot&amp;hellip; I made all the curriculum from scratch, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty proud of it so with their permission I&amp;rsquo;ve made it freely available here.</description>
